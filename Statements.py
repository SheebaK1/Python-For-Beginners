# In Python the statements are called as the instructions that a python interpreter can execute.

# Single line statements
A1 = 5 + 5
print(A1)

#Example 2 Single line statement
A2 =['a','b','c','d',1,2,3,4,5]
print("Example 2 =", A2)

# Multi-line statement = In Python, the statements are usually written in a single line and the last character of these lines is newline. To extend the statement to one or more lines we can use braces {}, parentheses (), square [], semi-colon “;”, and continuation character slash “\”. we can use any of these according to our requirement in the code.

A3 = 5 + 10 \
      + 20 + 30 \
     + 40 + 50
print ("Multi line statement =",A3)

A4 = [
      'a',
      'b',
      'c',
      'd'
      ]
print ("Multi line statement =", A4)
