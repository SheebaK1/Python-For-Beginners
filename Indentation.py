'''Python Indentation
Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.
Indentation in Python is very important.
Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.
If the indentation is not correct we will endup with IndentationError error

if 5 > 4:
    print ("5 is greater then 4")  # Correct Indentation
else:
    print ("5 is less then 4")
